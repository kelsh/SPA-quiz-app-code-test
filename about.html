        <h1> about </h1>
        <p>This was made over 10-12 hours.  Its not my cleanest work, but I tried to use a variety of techniques.  I took some photos of my notebook when I was sketching idea in the begining. I eventually decided to stick with the wireframe you guys provided, but I was imagining the menu being a permanent side nagivation that also showed which quizez you've took. The main thing I would add this in the future, is a better system for telling the user where they are and how they can progress through the quiz.
        </p>
        <p> One of the design choices I used was adding slight box shadow to the intial page buttons, and to the continue buttons to encourage the user to continue through the quiz.  It was simple one layer navigation so I chose to use a modal menu.  Easy to use and translates well across devices.  I changed the font size of the menu based on the vertical width of the screen to ensure that all menu items fit on the screen at all screen heights.
        </p>
        <p> I used slight CSS animations to let the user know their input was correctly recieved when clicking on a quiz answer.  I believe more could be done with the "continue" buttons to draw the users attention that they can now proceed.  I made sure to use the cursor to let the user know when they could and could not click on a link.
        </p>
        <p> The profile page was kind of a conundrum for me because on larger screen sizes there was a lot of empty space to fill.  I decided the "reward" for completing the quiz would be the extremely large color "success rate" to give the user a sense of completion, and mayeb encourage them to go through the quiz again.  On the profile page I stuggled to keep content symetrical despite the size disparity of the small icons and the possibility of a large "Unanswered".  If I re-did this I might try and make all of those elements more square shaped for uniformity.  I might also include other less important stats below the profile image such as time to completion and number of clicks. Just something to fill up the space and make the user feel like things were going on.
        </p>
        <h2>Techniques I used:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>loading pages with ajax</li>
                <li>data attributes</li>
                <li>CSS animations</li>
                <li>CSS hover states</li>
                <li>edited color of svg graphics directly</li>
                <li>HTML5 history</li>
                <li>checking to make sure arguements are correctly formatted</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Things I would do different:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Both my CSS and Javascript turned into a mess as I begin improvising </li>
                <li>Javascript variables should be semantic</li>
                <li>CSS classes and IDs names haphazardly, towards the middle I stopped writing and using re-useable CSS classes</li>
                <li>Use local storage to save quiz answers and the last page viewed</li>
                <li>Add a dramatic slide in effect as new pages are loaded over ajax(I would probably use a dummy element that slides in then display none once the content is loaded onto the page behind it)</li>
                <li>Allow a user to use the "forward" button on their browser</li>
                <li>More visual notifiers to the user when they've changed their answer</li>
                 <li>Colored red and green borders on the quiz answers once they've been selected</li>
                 <li> Use Spellcheck</li>
                 <li> Various standard front end practices like img alts, meta data, minification, image loaders</li>
            </ol>
